# Ficsit-CodeNode
Welcome to the FICSIT CodeNode!  For maximum efficiency, FICSIT has decided to centralize storage of all code related to our FICSIT Networks systems here.  New programs are being added all the time, so be sure to check back regularly!

Currently, the CodeNode simply hosts links to what people have put into the [FICSIT-Networks Discord server](https://discord.gg/3VfZ6Da); there is a potential for a direct mod link though.

For now, here's the list:
